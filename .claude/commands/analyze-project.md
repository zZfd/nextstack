# Analyze Project

## Description
Complete project structure analysis to understand architecture, patterns, and technical stack for effective AB Method task planning.

## Usage
```
/analyze-project
```

## Behavior
Loads and executes the analyze-project workflow from `.ab-method/core/analyze-project.md`

This workflow will:
1. Analyze the complete project structure and architecture
2. Document technology stack and frameworks in use
3. Identify coding patterns and conventions
4. Create comprehensive architecture documentation
5. Extract technical constraints and requirements

## Workflow Details
The analyze-project workflow provides:
- **Architecture Analysis** - Complete understanding of project structure
- **Tech Stack Documentation** - Cataloging frameworks, libraries, and tools
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying existing coding and design patterns
- **Documentation Creation** - Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Constraint Extraction** - Understanding limitations and requirements

## Examples
```
/analyze-project
# Performs complete project analysis
# Creates comprehensive architecture documentation
# Documents tech stack, patterns, and constraints for future tasks
```

## Alternative Usage
You can also use the traditional AB Method master controller:
```
/ab-master analyze-project
```
